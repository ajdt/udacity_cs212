# -----------------
# User Instructions
# 
# In this problem, you will solve the pouring problem for an arbitrary
# number of glasses. Write a function, more_pour_problem, that takes 
# as input capacities, goal, and (optionally) start. This function should 
# return a path of states and actions.
#
# Capacities is a tuple of numbers, where each number represents the 
# volume of a glass. 
#
# Goal is the desired volume and start is a tuple of the starting levels
# in each glass. Start defaults to None (all glasses empty).
#
# The returned path should look like [state, action, state, action, ... ]
# where state is a tuple of volumes and action is one of ('fill', i), 
# ('empty', i), ('pour', i, j) where i and j are indices indicating the 
# glass number.
