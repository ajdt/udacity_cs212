== Background ==
This repo contains my notes and code from the "design of computer programs (cs 212)"
class by Peter Norvig that's on Udacity. I took the class in fall 2012. It was an introduction to python
for me, so the repo contains lots of useful notes, and the first bits of code I wrote in python.
