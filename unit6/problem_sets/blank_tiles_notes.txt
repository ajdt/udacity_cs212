Norvig does a better job of not disturbing existing 
program structure.

> He doesn't have to modify calculate_score() b/c he
adds lowercase letters to the POINTS dictionary, mapping
them to 0
> he doesn't create new functions is_prefix or is_word
    > he just puts pre.upper() in a temporary variable
    and checks that against WORDS and PRE
> this makes his solution more elegant b/c he doesn't 
    have to make as many changes to the original code, just
    a few changes and some additions
